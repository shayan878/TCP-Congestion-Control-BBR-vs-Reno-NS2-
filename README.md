# TCP Congestion Control: BBR vs Reno

This repository contains the implementation, simulation, and analysis of **TCP congestion control algorithms**, focusing on **BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time)** and **Reno**.  
The project leverages **NS-2 (Network Simulator 2)** for network experiments, custom **C++ implementations** for BBR, and **Python scripts** for post-simulation data analysis.

## Features
- Implementation of **TCP BBR congestion control** in C++.
- Simulation of **BBR vs Reno** using **NS-2**.
- Collection of trace files (`.tr`, `.nam`) for detailed analysis.
- Python-based post-processing for performance evaluation.
- Visualization of results from network experiments.

---

## Requirements
- **NS-2** (Network Simulator 2)
- **GCC / g++** (for compiling the BBR C++ code)
- **Python 3.x** with libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`

---

## Usage

### 1. Compile BBR
```bash
cd "codes and files/C++ code for BBR"
ns make tcp-bbr.cc
```
### 2. Run Simulations
```bash
Copy code
cd "codes and files/otcl code and files"
```
# Run Reno simulation
```bash
ns reno.tcl
```
# Run BBR simulation
```bash
ns tcp-reno-bbr.tcl
```
- This will generate trace files (.tr) and animation files (.nam).

3. Analyze Results
```bash
Copy code
cd "codes and files/python code"
python3 analyze5.py
```
 Expected Output
- Trace files for each algorithm
- NAM visualizations showing network behavior
- Plots/graphs comparing throughput, delay, and fairness between Reno and BBR
